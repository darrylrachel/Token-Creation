# Project Overview: Custom ERC-721 Token Creation

**Part 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install Truffle
   Truffle is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts.

3. Set Up a Truffle Project:
   `code` truffle init

**Part 2: Writing the ERC-721 Smart Contract**
1. Create the Contract File:
  In the contracts directory, create a new file named <file-name>.sol.

**Breakdown**
1. OpenZeppelin: This is like a big toolbox filled with useful code for building smart contracts. It has been written and tested by lots of people, so it's very reliable.

2. ERC721: This is a type of smart contract that helps us create unique tokens called NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Each NFT is different from the others, like collectible cards.

3. Ownable: This is a piece of code that helps us manage who owns the smart contract. It lets us specify an owner who has special permissions.
